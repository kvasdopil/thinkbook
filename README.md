# Rules

- do not ask user to run dev server, assume it's already running
- after completion of every user-story, update this file, include implemented story in 'implemented stories' section, explain what was done
- use react-icons for all icons

# Guidelines

- make sure all buttons have enough spacing, have some hover effect, and use pointer cursor to indicate they are clickable

# Docs

- User stories are located in /docs/user-stories
- When creating a new user story put it in a separate file with a next available number.
- ALWAYS run tests and lint after finishing the task to make sure it is really complete
