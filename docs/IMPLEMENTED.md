- Message types follow user story specification: `{ type: "out" | "err", value: string }` for flexible rendering
- Streaming implementation preserves existing output buffering behavior (no maximum log size, append indefinitely)
- Worker communication uses unique message IDs to route streaming output to correct execution context
- Backward compatibility maintained with legacy `output` message type for existing functionality
- Proper cleanup and restoration of Python environment prevents infinite recursion and function conflicts
- All streaming output appears immediately during `print()` execution, not after script completion
