## 0002.SETTINGS_MODAL_GEMINI_KEY

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Summary:** Implemented a settings modal with Gemini AI API key configuration.

**Implementation Details:**

- Created `src/utils/storage.ts` - Storage helper module using localforage for persistent storage
- Created `src/hooks/useGeminiApiKey.ts` - React hook for managing Gemini API key state
- Created `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` - Modal component with password-masked input for Gemini key
- Created `src/services/aiService.ts` - AI service that uses stored Gemini API key
- Updated `src/App.tsx` to include settings button in header and auto-open logic
- Settings button with FiSettings icon is permanently visible in application header
- Modal auto-opens on first visit when no API key is stored
- Modal supports keyboard navigation, focus trapping, and ARIA accessibility
- Backdrop click and Escape key close the modal
- Form validation and error handling for API key storage

**Testing:**

- Unit tests for storage helper, React hooks, modal component, and AI service
- Playwright integration tests covering modal behavior, form interactions, and storage
- All tests pass with comprehensive coverage

**Files Modified:**

- `src/App.tsx` - Added header with settings button and modal integration
- `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` - New modal component
- `src/utils/storage.ts` - New storage helper
- `src/hooks/useGeminiApiKey.ts` - New React hook
- `src/services/aiService.ts` - New AI service
- Multiple test files for comprehensive coverage

## 0003.SETTINGS_MODAL_SNOWFLAKE

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Summary:** Extended settings modal to include Snowflake access token and hostname configuration.

**Implementation Details:**

- Extended `src/utils/storage.ts` with Snowflake token and hostname storage methods
- Created `src/hooks/useSnowflakeConfig.ts` - React hook for managing Snowflake configuration
- Updated `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` to include Snowflake access token (password-masked) and hostname (text) inputs
- Created `src/services/snowflakeService.ts` - Snowflake service using stored credentials
- Auto-open logic triggers when ANY required configuration (Gemini key, Snowflake token, or hostname) is missing
- Hostname normalization removes https:// prefix and trailing slashes
- Error handling for missing configuration with descriptive error messages

**Testing:**

- Extended unit tests to cover Snowflake configuration storage and hooks
- Added comprehensive tests for Snowflake service including URL construction and error handling
- Updated Playwright tests to verify all three configuration inputs
- Tests cover form validation, hostname normalization, and error scenarios

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` - Added Snowflake inputs
- `src/utils/storage.ts` - Added Snowflake storage methods
- `src/hooks/useSnowflakeConfig.ts` - New React hook for Snowflake config
- `src/services/snowflakeService.ts` - New Snowflake service
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated auto-open logic for all required config
- Extended test files for comprehensive coverage

**Technical Notes:**

- Both services throw descriptive errors when configuration is missing
- Storage uses localforage for browser persistence across sessions
- Modal maintains focus trapping and accessibility standards with additional inputs
- Hostname validation prevents double protocol prefixes
- Form handles partial configuration states gracefully
