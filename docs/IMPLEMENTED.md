## 0016.CODE_CELL_TOGGLE_AND_STATUS

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Summary:** Implemented code cell toggle and status functionality allowing users to collapse/expand code editors with eye icons, display execution status indicators with colors and icons, and show top-level comments as cell titles when collapsed.

**Implementation Details:**

- Enhanced `src/components/NotebookCell.tsx` - Implemented dual state rendering (collapsed/expanded) with visibility toggle, status indicators for all execution states, and comment extraction utility
- Updated `src/hooks/usePyodideWorker.ts` - Extended execution states to include `complete` and `failed` states alongside existing `idle`, `running`, `stopping`, `cancelled` states
- Added comment extraction utility function to parse Python top-level comments for use as cell titles in collapsed state
- Default state: code editor hidden with compact view showing status button, extracted title, and eye icon toggle button
- Status button combines execution action (Run/Stop) with visual status indicator using color-coded backgrounds and icons
- Status states mapped to appropriate colors: idle (gray), running (blue with spinner), complete (green with check), failed (red with warning), cancelled (gray with times), stopping (yellow with spinner)
- Collapsed state displays as inline-flex compact component with max-width constraint for mobile responsiveness
- Expanded state shows full editor interface with traditional header layout and separate run/stop buttons
- Smooth transitions between states using CSS `transition-all duration-200` classes
- Eye icon toggles between `FaRegEye` (show) and `FaRegEyeSlash` (hide) based on current visibility state
- Top-level comment extraction uses regex to find first `#` comment and strip formatting for clean title display
- Falls back to "Python Code" title when no comment is available in the code
- Full accessibility support with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility

**Testing:**

- Comprehensive unit tests for `NotebookCell.tsx` covering visibility toggle functionality, status indicator rendering, comment extraction, and accessibility features
- Updated all existing tests to work with new collapsed-by-default behavior

- Updated `src/components/AiChat.tsx` - Replaced single `NotebookCell` with `MultipleNotebookCells` component for multiple cells support throughout application
- Enhanced `src/ai-functions/listCells.ts` and `src/ai-functions/updateCell.ts` - Connected to real cell store data instead of mock data with notebook context management
- "Run All" button executes cells sequentially top-to-bottom with proper async/await handling and execution state management
- "Add Cell" button inserts new empty cells at list end with unique generated IDs
- Cell deletion requires user confirmation with modal dialog showing "Are you sure?" message
- Each cell maintains isolated output area with no system message contamination
- Single AI chat interface positioned at page top works with all cells simultaneously
- Running cells become non-editable during execution; "Run All" disabled when any cell is executing
