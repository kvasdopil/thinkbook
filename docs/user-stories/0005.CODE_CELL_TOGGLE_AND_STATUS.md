# Background

Currently, each code cell in the notebook is always visible and shows the full code editor. To improve focus while reading results and to save screen space, users need the ability to hide code after execution while still being able to see the resulting output and the cell’s current status.

# User story

> **As a** user reading or running a notebook
> **I want** to be able to toggle the visibility of a cell’s code editor
> **So that** I can collapse completed cells and concentrate on the narrative and results.

### Acceptance criteria

- A **toggle button** with an eye icon (from `react-icons`, e.g. `FaRegEye` when hidden, `FaRegEyeSlash` when visible) is rendered for every code cell.
- **Default state**: code editor is hidden; only the top‐level comment (markdown) at the beginning of the code file is displayed instead.
- Toggling the eye icon shows/hides the code editor instantly without re-executing code.
- A **status button** is shown next to the comment line. It reflects the current execution state with both color and icon/text:
  - **new** (never run)
  - **running** (in progress)
  - **complete** (finished successfully)
  - **failed** (errored)
  - **cancelled** (interrupted)
- When the status button is **hovered**:
  - If the cell is _not_ running, a tooltip (or button label change) offers **Run** action.
  - If the cell _is_ running, it offers a **Stop** action to cancel execution.
- All icons used (eye, play, stop, etc.) must come from `react-icons` and follow a consistent size and color scheme defined in the design system.
- Feature should work on desktop and mobile viewports (≥320px width).

# Implementation hints (clarified)

- **State management**:
  - Store visibility per cell in React component state or a higher-level context if needed for persistence.
  - Status enum can reuse existing execution state types.
- **Accessibility**: Buttons must include `aria-label`s and keyboard focus styles.
- **Animation**: A simple CSS transition (e.g. `max-height`) may be used for smooth collapse/expand.
- **Testing**: Provide unit tests for visibility toggle logic and status action handling.
