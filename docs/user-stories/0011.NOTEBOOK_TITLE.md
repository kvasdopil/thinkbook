# 0011.notebook-title

## Background

Notebooks should be easily identifiable. Without a visible, editable title, users struggle to differentiate between multiple open notebooks and to keep their workspace organised.

## User Story

> **As a** data scientist
> **I want** to edit a notebook’s title directly in the interface
> **So that** I can label and organise my notebooks quickly

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A header appears as the first (non-sticky) element above all messages and cells. When a notebook is scrolled the header SHOULD NOT stay at the top of the screen.
2. The header contains an editable title rendered as a transparent `<input>` styled like an `h1` (`text-3xl font-bold leading-tight outline-none bg-transparent`).
3. Clicking anywhere on the title focuses the input; users can change the text at any time.
4. Title changes are persisted via `useNotebookFiles`, updating the file’s `title` property and `updatedAt` only when the value actually changes.
5. On reload or file switch, the saved title is displayed correctly.
6. A settings icon (`FaCog`) is displayed at the right end of the header; clicking opens the existing Settings modal.
7. The header contains **only** the title input and the settings icon—no additional UI elements.
8. Icons and input are fully keyboard-accessible (`tabIndex`, `aria-label`) and meet WCAG 2.1 AA colour contrast.
9. Unit tests cover title editing, persistence, and correct rendering on reload and file switch.
10. All existing lint, type-check, and Jest test suites pass.
11. The changes should be applied to file panel and updatedAt after onBlur, or on enter key press.

## Technical Notes

- Reuse `useNotebookFiles` hook for persistence.
- Create a `NotebookHeader` component rendered above `ConversationList`.

## Potential Pitfalls

- Unintended `updatedAt` updates on every keystroke—use debounced or onBlur persistence.
- Focus management when switching files while editing title.

## Definition of Done

- All acceptance criteria are met
- Unit / integration tests pass
- Lint & type-check succeed
- Documentation (README, Storybook, etc.) is updated
