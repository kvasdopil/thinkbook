0011.ai_output_markdown_rendering

Background

AI-generated responses are a core feature of the notebook application, supporting code, explanations, and data. Currently, output rendering lacks support for rich Markdown, limiting expressiveness and usability. Enabling full Markdown rendering will improve clarity, allow formatted code and tables, and make results more actionable.

User Story

As a notebook userI want AI outputs to be rendered as full Markdown (including code blocks, tables, lists, etc.)So that I can read, copy, and interact with AI-generated content easily and in the format most useful for my workflow.

Acceptance Criteria

1. AI outputs are rendered using a Markdown renderer supporting all standard Markdown features (code blocks, tables, lists, headings, images, etc.).

2. The AI output area takes the full width of its container, without any background color or border.

3. Markdown layouts (tables, lists, etc.) display correctly on all supported devices and screen sizes.

4. Very large tables within AI output scroll horizontally (only the table, not the whole conversation).

5. All output is text-only; no images, icons, or interactive elements are added by default.

6. No accessibility (a11y) features are required for this story.

Technical Notes

• Use a robust Markdown renderer such as react-markdown or @uiw/react-markdown-preview.

• Ensure CSS for tables (overflow-x: auto) is scoped to Markdown content only.

• Do not restrict particular Markdown features; allow full syntax.

• Follow existing container and layout conventions for conversation items.

• No background or border, matching the surrounding conversation UI.

Out of Scope

• Accessibility improvements (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation) are not included.

• Custom rendering for non-standard Markdown extensions.

• Non-text content (e.g., images, embedded media).

Potential Pitfalls

• Large tables may overflow container if horizontal scrolling is not correctly implemented.

• Some Markdown features may be unsupported by chosen renderer; test all required syntax.

• CSS specificity issues may cause unwanted background/border or layout bugs.

Definition of Done

• All acceptance criteria are met

• Unit / integration tests pass

• Lint & type-check succeed

• Documentation (README, Storybook, etc.) is updated
