# 0012.notebook-deletion

## Background

Users need a quick way to remove obsolete notebooks without leaving the main workspace. A direct deletion action in the notebook header streamlines housekeeping tasks.

## User Story

> **As a** data scientist
> **I want** to delete the current notebook from the header
> **So that** I can keep my workspace clean and focused on relevant notebooks

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A trash icon (`FaTrash`) appears in the notebook header immediately to the right of the settings icon.
2. Pressing the trash icon opens the native `confirm()` dialog with the exact message: “Delete this notebook? This action cannot be undone.”
3. If the user confirms, the notebook file is deleted via `useNotebookFiles.deleteNotebook(id)` (or equivalent helper).
4. After deletion, the next notebook (by most recent `updatedAt`) loads automatically; if no notebooks remain, a default behaviour for _empty file list_ condition is used.
5. If the user cancels, no changes occur.
6. `FilePanel` list updates immediately to reflect the deletion.
7. The trash icon is keyboard-accessible (`tabIndex`, `aria-label`) and meets WCAG 2.1 AA colour contrast.
8. Unit tests cover confirmation flow, successful deletion, cancellation path, and correct fallback when no notebooks remain.
9. All existing lint, type-check, and Jest test suites pass.

## Technical Notes (optional)

- Extend `useNotebookFiles` with `deleteNotebook(id)` and `selectNextNotebook()` helpers.
- Ensure state synchronisation across `Home` component and `FilePanel` after deletion.

## Potential Pitfalls

- Selecting an unintended notebook after deletion—ensure deterministic ordering (e.g., by `updatedAt` desc).
- Deletion while the title input is focused—manage focus to avoid errors.

## Definition of Done

- All acceptance criteria are met
- Unit / integration tests pass
- Lint & type-check succeed
- Documentation (README, Storybook, etc.) is updated
