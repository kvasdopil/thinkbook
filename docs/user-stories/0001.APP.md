# 0001.app

## Background

The foundation is a single-page web application for running Jupyter-style notebooks in the browser. This establishes the basic Next.js architecture and development environment.

## User Story

> **As a** developer setting up the project  
> **I want** a minimal Next.js application with proper tooling  
> **So that** I can build upon a solid foundation with consistent coding standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User can open the app and see a "Hello World" message on the initial page
2. Application uses Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
3. ESLint is configured with Airbnb style guide for code quality
4. Prettier is set up for consistent code formatting
5. Turbopack is enabled for fast development builds
6. All source code is organized under `/src` with proper subdirectories

## Technical Notes

- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier with Airbnb configuration
- **Build Tool**: Turbopack for faster development
- **Structure**: `/src/app` (routes), `/src/components`, `/src/utils`, `/src/hooks`

## Definition of Done

- All acceptance criteria are met
- NPM scripts work: `dev`, `build`, `lint`, `format`
- `lint` script also checks typescript compilation validity
- Lint & type-check succeed
- Project follows established coding standards
