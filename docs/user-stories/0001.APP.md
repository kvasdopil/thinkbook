## Background

The foundation is a single-page web application for running Jupyter-style notebooks in the browser. This establishes the basic Next.js architecture and development environment.

## User Story

> **As a** developer setting up the project  
> **I want** a minimal Next.js application with proper tooling  
> **So that** I can build upon a solid foundation with consistent coding standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User can open the app and see a "Hello World" message on the initial page
2. Application uses Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
3. ESLint is configured for code quality
4. Prettier is set up for consistent code formatting
5. Turbopack is enabled for fast development builds
6. All source code is organized under `/src` with proper subdirectories
7. Basic Playwright test verifies the "Hello World" message is displayed

## Technical Notes

- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Build Tool**: **Turbopack** for faster development <-- make sure to use this one so installation is smooth
- **Structure**: `/src/app` (routes), `/src/components`, `/src/utils`, `/src/hooks`
- do not create environment yourself, use `create-next-app`
- use app router
- create a new env in this directory, we only have docs here so create-next-app wont complain
- prettier should support latest eslint syntax, trailing commas everywhere, single quotes
- app should only support light color scheme
- Playwright is used for end-to-end testing
- Test files are located in `/tests` directory

## Definition of Done

- All acceptance criteria are met
- NPM scripts work: `dev`, `build`, `lint`, `format`, `test`
- `lint` script also checks typescript compilation validity
- Lint & type-check succeed
- Project follows established coding standards
- Playwright test passes
